Special thanks to @sharkbound for the help with fetching and pulling apart the data off goodreads.com (their "API" is a joke btw.)
Also special thanks to @ir-3 and @Harrryyyy for helping with getting the second prefix running, testing misc stuff

## Used External Libs:

```
import discord
import aiohttp
import wikipedia
import praw
import pytz
import requests
from wiktionaryparser import WiktionaryParser
from pytz import timezone 
from discord.ext import commands
```
## Get started:

You can download the `setup.sh` to install and start the setup up the bot with all you need automatically with:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x3l51/discord_bot/master/setup.sh ; sudo bash setup.sh
```

Else you can setup everything manually:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
cd /opt
sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.6/Python-3.6.6.tar.xz
sudo tar xf Python-3.6.6.tar.xz
cd Python-3.6.6/
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make altinstall
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-lxml
sudo python3.6 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo python3.6 -m pip install -U discord.py
sudo python3.6 -m pip install requests-xml
sudo python3.6 -m pip install wikipedia
sudo python3.6 -m pip install wiktionaryparser
sudo python3.6 -m pip install praw
sudo python -m pip install pytz
cd ~
sudo mkdir projects
cd projects
sudo wget https://github.com/x3l51/discord_bot/archive/master.zip
sudo unzip master.zip
sudo chmod 777 credentials.log
sudo chmod 777 members.log
```

Open `setup.py` (`sudo python3.6 setup.py`- will autoomatically be opened if you use the `setup.sh`) and fill in the token for Discord, the role ID's for the administrators/ mods of your server (find out by `\@ROLE_MENTION` into chat on server), reddit api client ID/ client secret/ user agent, ID auf the author (same method as with roles `\@AUTHER_MENTION`) and the goodreads key. The Discord Token is the only thin mandatory, you can leave the rest blank if you'd like. Most funtions will not work properly then.

To start the bot simply use `python3.6 bcad_bot3.6.py`(will automatically start if you use the `setup.sh`).

If you run into any issues, look up the documentation as provided on top of this `readme.md` or file an issue.
